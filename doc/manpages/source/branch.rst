SYNOPSIS
********
geogit branch [<options>] [<branchname> [<startpoint>]]
geogit branch --delete <branchname>...
geogit branch --rename [--force] [<oldBranchName>] <newBranchName>

DESCRIPTION
***********

With no arguments the command will display all existing branches with the current branch
highlighted with the asterisk. The -r option will list only remote branches and the -a option will list both local and remote branches. Adding the --color option with the value of auto, always, or never will add or remove color from the listing. With the -v option it will list the branches along with the commit id and commit message that the branch is currently on.

With a branch name specified it will create a branch of off the current branch. If a start point is specified as well then it will be created off of the given start point. If the -c option is given it will automatically checkout the branch once it is created.

With the -d option with a branch name specified will delete that branch. You cannot delete the branch that you are currently on, checkout a different branch to delete it. Also with the -d option you can list multiple branches for deletion.

With the -m option you can specify an oldBranchName to rename with the given newBranchName or you can rename the current branch by not specifying oldBranchName. With the --force option you can rename a branch to a name that already exists as a branch, however this will delete the other branch.
