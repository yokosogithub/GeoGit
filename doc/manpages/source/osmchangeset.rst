Two commits can be specified for comparison. If no commit is specified, the working tree and index will be compared. If only one commit is specified, it will compare the working tree with the given commit

Only the ``node`` and ``way`` trees are compared to find the differences between the specified commits. Changes in other trees will be ignored, and no changeset entries will be created based on them.
