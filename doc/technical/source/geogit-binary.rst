Binary encoding of GeoGit objects
=================================

This is the format used for internal storage in the GeoGit object store.

Conventions
-----------

Formats are specified using a modified Backus-Naur notation.
Definitions generally take the form::

    <structure> := part1 part2 part3

Indicating that the structure has three parts.
The parts can be:

* Another structure, referenced by name.
* One of these specially defined structures

  .. code-block:: none

    NUL       := 0x00 (ASCII NUL character)
    SP        := 0x20 (ASCII space character)
    BR        := 0x0a (ASCII newline character)
    <rev>     := <byte>* (exactly 20 bytes)
    <utf8>    := <int16> <byte>* (two-byte count followed by the number
				  of bytes indicated by the count. 
				  These should then be decoded as 
				  modified UTF-8, as seen in the 
				  readUTF and writeUTF methods in the
    				  java.io.DataInputStream and
    				  java.io.DataOutputStream classes 
				  in the Java Standard Library.)
    <byte>    := (8 bit byte)
    <int16>   := (16 bit signed integer, "short" in Java)
    <int32>   := (32 bit signed integer, "int" in Java)
    <int64>   := (64 bit signed integer, "long" in Java)
    <float32> := (32 bit IEEE floating point value, "float" in Java)
    <float64> := (64 bit IEEE floating point value, "double" in Java)

* A literal byte sequence.  These are generally used as markers and are represented as text in double quotes (`"`).
  These markers will always be constrained to printable ASCII characters and should be encoded as ASCII, one byte per character.
* A literal byte, specified as a hexidecimal string (for example, 0xFF).
* any of the above suffixed by a modifier:

  * An asterisk (`*`) to indicate 0 or more repetitions
  * A number in brackets (`[]`) to indicate a specific number of repetitions.
* Comments sometimes appear to clarify the intent of certain structures.
  These will be enclosed in parentheses (`()`).
 
Commit
------

.. code-block:: none

    commit := commitHeader treeRef parent* authorLine committerLine message
    commitHeader := "commit" NUL
    treeRef := 0x01 <rev>
    parent  := 0x02 <rev>
    authorLine := 0x03 person
    committerLine := 0x04 person
    person := name email timestamp tzOffset
    name := <utf8>
    email := <utf8>
    timestamp := <int64>
    tzOffset := <int32>
    message := <utf8>

Tree
----

.. note:: 
    In representing trees we split the count of tree contents into three fields:
    features, trees, and buckets. Because of the way GeoGit builds trees,
    buckets must be zero when either of the other two fields is nonzero.

    We should probably document how exactly GeoGit builds trees :)

.. code-block:: none

    tree := treeHeader size treeCount features trees buckets
    size := <int64> (the total [recursive] count of features in this tree)
    treeCount := <int32> (in a bucket tree: the number of trees that are
			  direct children of the bucket tree. In a node 
			  tree: 0)
    features := count node*
    trees := count node*
    buckets := count bucket*
    count := <int32>
    node := name objectId metadataId envelope nodeType
    name := <utf8>
    objectId := <byte>[20]
    metadataId := <byte>[20]
    envelope := <float64>[4] (minx, maxx, miny, maxy.  Note that this may be 
			     (0, -1, 0, -1) as is traditional for indicating
			     NULL envelopes. Of course empty (zero-area) 
			     envelopes are valid as well.)
    nodeType := <byte> (0x01: Tree, 0x02: Feature)
    bucket := index objectId envelope
    index := <int32>

Feature

    booleanArray            := 0x09 <int32> <byte>* (note that the int is the number of boolean values and booleans are packed to save space. so the number of bytes is actually the count of bits divided by 8)

    bigDecimalField         := 0x1B <int32> <int32> <byte>* (scale, length of byte array, byte array)
    datetimeField           := 0x1C <int64> (milliseconds since unix epoch)
    dateField               := 0x1D <int64> (datetime with hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds all set to 0)
    timeField               := 0x1E <int64> (datetime with years, months, days all set to zero (ie, a time on Jan 1 1970))
    timestampField          := 0x1F <int64> <int32> (datetime followed by a specifier of nanoseconds within the millisecond)

				     identifier. If it uses URI notation
