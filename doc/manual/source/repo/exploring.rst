Exploring a repository
======================

The entire contents of a GeoGit repository are stored in the ``.geogit`` directory.

Unlike a version control system like Git, the content of the current working tree cannot be explored directly as a normal folder containing files, so they are stored instead in a database which holds the complete structure of the repository. This means that any files stored in the same directory that contains the ``.geogit`` directory will be ignored by GeoGit.

Therefore, exploring a GeoGit repository must be done using GeoGit commands. The main commands used for this task are:

* ``ls``: lists the content of a tree
* ``show``: prints a formatted version of an element of the repository

Listing trees
-------------

The basic ``ls`` command takes the following form:

.. code-block:: console

   geogit ls [ref]:[path]

The ``[ref]:[path]`` parameter defines the path to be listed. If it contains no ``ref`` part, it will list the given path in the current working tree. To list the same path in a different reference, a full reference can be provided. For instance, to list the content of ``parks`` in the current HEAD, the following line should be used:

.. code-block:: console
  
   geogit ls HEAD:parks

The provided reference and path should resolve to a tree. Since features do not contains other elements, their content cannot be listed with the ``ls`` command, but instead must be used with the ``show`` command.

An object ID can be used directly instead of a ``[ref]:[path]``. So one can use the ID of a commit and list the contents of the tree corresponding to that commit.

The options available for the ``ls`` command control how the list of elements under the given path is printed.

* The ``-v`` option (for "**verbose**") will list not just the name of the objects, but also the object's ID and the ID of the corresponding feature type.
* The ``-r`` option will list the contents of subtrees **recursively**. The names of these subtrees are not shown in the listing, but you can specify GeoGit to add them by using the ``-t`` option along with ``-d``.
* The ``-a`` option (for "**abbreviate**") will show IDs in their abbreviated form. Use a number to determine how many digits of the ID to display (``-a 7`` for seven digit IDs).

Here are some examples of the ``ls`` command:

Recursive list:

.. code-block:: console

   geogit ls -r -t

Showing features
----------------

Describing an element in a GeoGit repository is done using the ``show`` command. It can be used to describe any type of object, unlike ``ls`` which needs to resolve to a tree.

The ``show`` command prints a formatted description of a given element. This description is a human-readable version of the element. 

The command takes as input a string that defines the object to describe. All supported notations are allowed for both commands, as they are described in :ref:`referencing`.

Below you can find the output of the  ``show`` command for certain types of objects.

The example below shows the use of the ``show`` command with a tree:

.. code-block:: console

   geogit show parks

.. code-block:: console

   TREE ID:  0bbed3603377adfbd3b32afce4d36c2c2e59d9d4
   SIZE:  50
   NUMBER OF SUBTREES:  0
   DEFAULT FEATURE TYPE ID:  6350a6955b124119850f5a6906f70dc02ebb31c9

   DEFAULT FEATURE TYPE ATTRIBUTES

   name: <STRING>
   number_fac: <Long>
   owner: <STRING>
   parktype: <STRING>
   the_geom: <MULTIPOLYGON>
   usage: <STRING>


When specifying a single feature, the ``show`` command prints the values of all attributes, and their corresponding names taken from the associated feature type.

.. code-block:: console
  
   geogit show HEAD:parks/1

.. code-block:: console

   ID:  ff51bfc2a36d02a3a51d72eef3e7f44de9c4e231

   ATTRIBUTES
   ----------
   agency: Medford School District
   area: 636382.400857
   len: 3818.6667552
   name: Abraham Lincoln Elementary

   the_geom: MULTIPOLYGON (((-122.83646412838807 42.36016644633764, ...

The following example shows the output of the ``show`` command when used on a commit reference:

.. code-block:: console

   geogit show 509a481257c5791f50f5a35087e432247f9dc8b7

.. code-block:: console

   Commit:        509a481257c5791f50f5a35087e432247f9dc8b7
   Author:        Author <author@example.com>
   Committer:     Author <author@example.com>
   Author date:   (3 hours ago) Mon Jan 21 13:58:55 CET 2013
   Committer date:(3 hours ago) Mon Jan 21 13:58:55 CET 2013
   Subject:       Updated geometry


You can also use a reference like ``HEAD`` to show the current state of the repository:

.. code-block:: console

   geogit show HEAD

Globbing
--------

Some commands in GeoGit, such as ``ls`` and ``show``, support using wildcards. This way, you can more easily select a set of objects without having to type the name of each of them.

GeoGit uses globbing notation similar to the program `ant <http://ant.apache.org>`_, supporting the most common wildcards, namely ``*``, ``?`` and ``**``.

* The ``*`` character can be any string of any length (including zero)
* The ``?`` represents a single character.
* The ``**`` string is used to indicate any path, so it will cause the command to recursively search into a given path.

For instance, the string ``roads/**/???`` will return all features with a name containing only three characters in any path under ``roads``. That includes ``roads/N501``, and also ``roads/spain/madrid/N501``

Since objects are not stored in the filesystem, but in the repository database, the expansion of wildcards is not (and should not be) performed by the command-line interpreter, but by the GeoGit interpreter itself.

.. note:: For more information, please see the section about `directory-based tasks <http://ant.apache.org/manual/dirtasks.html>`_ in the ant manual.
