The GeoGit logging system
=========================

GeoGit has a loging system that you might need to check, specially in case of having issues.

.. note:: This is not to be confused with the reflog that Git implements, and that GeoGit will eventually have as well. Tthis is just a log of errors, warnings and message of several types, useful to be able to trace the activity of GeoGit and analyze and debug it.

If a GeoGit command cannot be run and GeoGit know the reason for that (for instance, you have entered a wrong parameter or the repository is corrupted), it will show you an explanation in the console. It might happen, however, that an error appears during execution and GeoGit cannot handle that and turn it into a meaningful explanation. In that case, the most detailed description of the error that is possible to produce will be stored in the loggin file, and GeoGit will tell you to go to that file in case you want more information.

The logging file records information about the activity of GeoGit on a given repository, including, but not limited to, error traces. In case you are a programmer, this might help you understand what is happening. If not, you can use the content of the log file to provide more detailed information to GeoGit developers, or when asking for a solugio in the GeoGit mailing list, so it is important to know how to find the logging file.

By default, the loggin file is located in your repository folder, under ''.geogit/log/geogit.log''

GeoGit uses the `Logback <http://logback.qos.ch/>`_ framework for logging. Check its documentation to know more about how to configure logback.

Apart from the logging file you will find other files in the ``log`` folder. Metrics are colelcted in the ``metrics.csv`` file, but you have to explicitely enable it, since that is not enabled by default. On the console, type the following.

::

	$ geogit config metrics.enabled true

Now, whenever you call a GeoGit command, the running time of all internal operations that are called will be saved to the metrics file.
