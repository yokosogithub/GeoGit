GeoGit Networking
=================

In order for geogit clients to be able interact with a repository remotely, it must be exposed over a network as a service. This can  be accomplished in 2 different ways both of which are still under active development. With a local clone of the geogit source tree, mvn can be used to start a development server, and GeoServer can be built with GeoGit support. Both methods are described below.

More background information on GeoGit remotes can be found elsewhere in the manual and the technical docs.

Standalone Testing Server
=========================

To start the geogit network develoment server from a local clone of the GeoGit source tree in the src/parent directory::

    mvn jetty:run -pl ../web/app -f pom.xml -Dorg.geogit.web.repository=/Users/jj0hns0n/data/gisdata-repo/
    
Output similar to the following indicates everything is working correctly.

GeoServer
=========

GeoServer can be built with GeoGit support enabling a GeoGit repository to be exposed as a remote for cloning, pushing and pulling as well as via OGC services (WMS/WFS/WMTS etc). Each top level tree in a GeoGit repository corresponds to a GeoServer layer. GeoServer treats a GeoGit repository as a store in much the same way as it does a database.

Building GeoServer/GeoTools GeoGit Extension
--------------------------------------------

The GeoGit module is not currently included in GeoServers community extensions, so you must build in this support by using OpenGeo's fork of GeoServer in the geogit branch https://github.com/opengeo/geoserver/tree/geogit or by adding the following dependencies to your own pom.xml::

     <dependencies>
        <dependency>
          <groupId>org.geogit</groupId>
          <artifactId>geogit-web-api</artifactId>
          <version>0.3-SNAPSHOT</version>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
          <groupId>org.geogit</groupId>
          <artifactId>geogit-geotools</artifactId>
          <version>0.3-SNAPSHOT</version>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
          <groupId>org.geogit</groupId>
          <artifactId>geogit-geoserver</artifactId>
          <version>0.3-SNAPSHOT</version>
        </dependency>
      </dependencies>

Include the plugin in your mvn build command::

    mvn clean install -Pgeogit

Deploy the resulting war in a servlet container.

Configuring a GeoGit Store in GeoServer
---------------------------------------

When GeoServer is built with GeoGit support, it will be available as a Store type in the GeoServer admin UI.

.. figure:: ../img/geogit-store.png

You can then configure a store by providing the path to the repository on the filesystem of the GeoServer installation. 

.. figure:: ../img/configure-geogit-repo-store.png

You will need to publish each top level tree as a layer individually.

.. figure:: ../img/geogit-publish-layer.png

It may be necessary to specify the SRS for your data it if is not recognized by GeoServer.

.. figure:: ../img/configure-layer-declared-srs.png


Cloning Pushing and Pulling
---------------------------

Once GeoServer is configured with this repository, you can address it over the network at a URL path of the form:: 

    http://<host>:<port>/geoserver/geogit/<workspace>:<store>

A sample url as configured in the screenshots above::

    http://localhost:8080/geoserver/geogit/topp:gisdata-repo

It is then possible to clone this repository::

    $ geogit clone http://localhost:8080/geoserver/geogit/topp:gisdata-repo gisdata-repo-clone

Your clone will be configured with the geoserver repository as a remote. This configuration is stored in .geogit/config in your clone::

    [remote\origin]
    url = http://localhost:8080/geoserver/geogit/topp:gisdata-repo
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
    
    [branches\master]
    remote = origin
    merge = refs/heads/master

It is now possible to push and pull from this remote repository. You can verify this works by testing with the freshly cloned repo::

    $ geogit push origin
    Nothing to push.
    
    $ geogit pull origin
    100%
    Already up to date.

Automated Repository Synchronization
------------------------------------

Repositories configured by GeoServer can be configured with remotes and Automated Repository Syncrhonization. TODO


Current Limitations
===================

The default underlying object database (berkeley db) is single user. While the repository is being exposed over the network by either the stand-alone server or by GeoServer, you will not be able to access the repo from the command line interface. The error is pretty clear about whats going on. 

com.sleepycat.je.EnvironmentLockedException: (JE 5.0.58) /Users/jj0hns0n/data/gisdata-repo/.geogit/objects The environment cannot be locked for single writer access. ENV_LOCKED: The je.lck file could not be locked. Environment is invalid and must be closed.
