Web-Api Documentation
==============================

This will walk you through GeoGit's web-api and all of its currently supported functionality. This doc also assumes that you already know what any given command does, this is strictly how to use these commands. First I will explain an easy way to get the web-api up and running.

If you don't already have the GeoGit source from GitHub and a GeoGit repository set up do that first. Next, to get the web-api up and running after you have built the latest GeoGit go into the web/app folder in the GeoGit source and run this command: 
``mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=org.geogit.web.Main -Dexec.args=/Path/To/Repo``. This will set up a jetty server with your repository and give you access to the web-api. Now you just need to open up a web browser and go to localhost:8182/log to make sure it comes up. After you have gotten it up and running now you can test any of the commands listed here.

All web-api commands have transaction support, which means you can run the web-api commands beginTransaction to start a transaction and then use the id that is returned to do other commands on that transaction instead of the actual repository. After you are done with everything on the transaction you just have call endTransaction through the web-api and pass it the transaction id. Some commands require a transaction to preserve the stability of the repository, those that require it will have ``(-T)`` next to the name of the command in this doc. To pass the transaction id you just need to use the transactionId option and set it equal to the id that beginTransaction returns. Some commands also have other options that required for that command to work they will be italicized in this doc. Any options that have notes associated with them have and asterisk next to them.

.. note:: All web-api command response are formatted for xml by default, however you can get a JSON response by adding this option to the url ``output_format=JSON``.

Web-Api Specific
-----------------------------

There is currently only one web-api specific function at this time and it is to traverse the entire commit graph. It starts at the specified commitId and works its way down the graph to either the initial commit or the specified depth. Since it traverses the actual commit graph, unlike log, it will display multiple parents and will list every single commit that runs down each parents history.

- GetCommitGraph

	Currently Supported Options:
		a) depth - the depth to search to
			Type: Integer
			
			Default: 0
		b) *commitId* - the id of the commit to start at
			Type: String
			
			Default: ObjectId.NULL
		c) page - the page number to build the response
			Type: Integer
			
			Default: 0
		d) show - the number of elements to list per page
			Type: Integer
			
			Default: 30

 ::

	Example: localhost:8182/getCommitGraph?show=100

Issues
=======

The main concern with the web-api currently is that it doesn't have any kind of authentication on it, which means that anyone with the url can potentially destroy your repo or steal you data with commands like updateref and pull.

There is also a lot of room for improvement and optimization. There are also several commands that still need to be exposed through the web-api.
