Welcome to the GeoGit project, exploring the use of distributed management of spatial data. GeoGit draws inspiration from `Git <http://git-scm.com/>`_, but adapts its core concepts to handle versioning of geospatial data. Users are able to import raw geospatial data (currently from Shapefiles, PostGIS or SpatiaLite) in to a repository where every change to the data is tracked. These changes can be viewed in a history, reverted to older versions, branched in to sandboxed areas, merged back in, and pushed to remote repositories. GeoGit is written in Java, available under the BSD License.

For background reading see these two papers on the spatial distributed versioning `Concept <http://boundlessgeo.com/whitepaper/new-approach-working-geospatial-data-part-1/>`_, 
`Implementation <http://boundlessgeo.com/whitepaper/distributed-versioning-geospatial-data-part-2//>`_, and `Potential Development <http://boundlessgeo.com/whitepaper/distributed-versioning-geospatial-data-part-3/>`_.
