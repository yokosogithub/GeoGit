geospatial data to a PostGIS database.

Build
=====

The GeoGit PostGIS extension is built using Maven::
  
  cd src
  mvn clean install

Functional Tests
----------------

Functional tests require a PostGIS database that can be used for testing, and are run with the online profile::

  mvn -Ponline
  
The PostGIS database must be populated with the test tables from the .sql file::

  'src/test/resources/org/geogit/pg/cli/test/functional/geogit_pg_test.sql'
  
When the functional tests are run for the first time, a database configuration file will be created at the
user root directory called '.geogit-pg-tests.properties'.  Open this file and enter the connection information
for the test database.

Additional Profiles
-------------------
    
Any additional build profiles are documented in the root `pom.xml`:pom.xml .

If you would like to work in Eclipse use of the `m2eclipse plugin <http://www.sonatype.org/m2eclipse>`_ recommended.

Please carefully apply the code formatting options in the buld/eclipse/formatter.xml file. These are the standard
Java formatting options with 100 character line length for both code and comments, and 4 spaces for indentation.
It is also recommended to use the code templates from build/eclipse/codetemlates.xml.
